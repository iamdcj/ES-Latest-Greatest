This repository contains explanations and code examples related to ECMAScript 2015(and onwards)'s most useful features

ECMAScript is the standards body for the JavaScript language - it is responsible for handling the language's specification, which is currently in its 10th Edition - ECMAScript 2019.

Most of the features in this repository will be from the 6th Edition of the language - ECMAScript 2015; this was a major release, containing many new features and syntax.
