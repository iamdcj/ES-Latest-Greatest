# Const

The `const` statement is used to declare constant bindings in a program.

Constant declarations must be initialized; you cannot simply declare a `const`, it must be assigned a value on creation.

### Scope
`const` declarations can either be scoped globally, or local to its wrapping function or block.

__Global__
Constants can be declared in the global lexical environment;
```
const Dave = "David";
```

However they do not become members of the `window` object;
```
console.log(window.Dave); // undefined
```

__Function__
Any `const` declared in a function body are scoped to that function's lexical environment, and its descendant lexical environments;
```
function test() {
  const foo = "bar"
  console.log(foo);

  function test2() {
    console.log(foo);

  }

  test2();
}
test()

// bar
// bar
```

__Block__
Any `const` declared in a block are scope to that particular block;
```
{
  const Dave = "David";
}

console.log(Dave) Uncaught ReferenceError: Dave is not defined
```

Unlike `var` statements which do leak outside of blocks;
```
{
  var Dave = "David";
}

console.log(Dave) // David
```

This provides a convenient way to shield bindings from the global scope, opposed to using an `IIFE` to initialize the program.

### Reassign / Redeclare 
Constants cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

__Reassignment__
```
const name = "David";

name = "David Jones"; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

__Redeclaration__
```
const name = "David";

const name = "David Jones"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
```


### Mutations
Constants cannot be reassigned or redeclared, however if they are initialized with a composite value the contents of the compiste, e.g. an array or object, can be mutated.

__Object__
```
const testObj = {
  name: "David";
}

console.log(testObj.name) // David

testObj.name = "David Jones";

console.log(testObj.name) // David Jones

```

__Array__
```
const testArray = [1, 2, 3, 4]

console.log(testArray) // (4) [1, 2, 3, 4]

testArray.push(5);

console.log(testArray) // (5) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

`const` declarations are affected by the `temporal dead zone`.
