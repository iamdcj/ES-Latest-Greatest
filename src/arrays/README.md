# Arrays

ES6 provides a number of really useful additions when it comes to working with arrays in modern applications, such as: [helper methods](#helpers), [chaining](#chaining), [comprehension](#comprehension).

### **Helpers**

The most useful additions in ES6 are the collection of 'helper' methods available to the engineer when working with arrays in modern javascript applications;

- [forEach](./forEach/)
- [map](./map/)⁺
- [filter](./filter/)⁺
- [reduce](./reduce)⁺
- [find](./find)
- [findIndex](./findIndex)
- [includes](./includes)
- [every](./every)
- [some](./some)

⁺ **chainable** - these will return a new array.

### **Chaining**

Another useful feature in ES6 is the ability to chain certain methods, these include;

- [map](./map/)⁺
- [filter](./filter/)⁺
- [reduce](./reduce)⁺
